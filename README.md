This is an android app that displays live player count of Dying light, an awesome game i used to play on steam. The data is processed by parsing a live JSON from https://steamdb.info/. The live counter is refreshed every 5 minutes so as to avoid the Rate limiting of the API. The whole look &amp; feel of the app is identical to the game's. Users can check the so called "weather" of the game in seconds without having to go to community hub.
